# JavaScript Data-Visualisation

There are plenty of libraries for data visualisation. The top languages for this task are Java, C and Python based on TIOBE Index.

If you want to use Python I recommend to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and try out the Jupiter Notebook which is an easy to learn Application

For this Demo I wanted to try one of the Javascript Libraries. You will find more information here [Plainenglish.io](https://plainenglish.io/blog/27-javascript-data-visualization-libraries-for-2022-48400795d224)

For no reason I took [D3JS](https://d3js.org/). You can embed the cdn link into your HTML and start coding.
